**Green Tomorrow** is an interactive tool designed to help you measure your **carbon footprint** — the total amount of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, that your lifestyle and choices emit into the atmosphere.

---

### 🧠 What is a Carbon Footprint?

A **carbon footprint** includes emissions from:
- 🏠 Household energy use (heating, electricity)
- 🚗 Transportation (car, flights, public transport)
- 🍔 Food and consumption habits
- 🛒 Shopping, waste, and more

It's measured in **tons of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e)**.

### 🚨 Why It Matters

The higher our carbon footprint, the more we contribute to climate change. By understanding your own emissions, you can:

- Reduce your environmental impact
- Save money through efficient choices
- Join the global effort to combat the climate crisis
